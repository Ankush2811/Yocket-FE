# Outline: 
A notorious criminal escape artist has vanished again. However, the criminal may be hiding in only one of the possible 5 neighbouring cities. 3 fearless cops have volunteered in capturing the fugitive hiding and they need your help!

## Technologies:
Frontend: Vue, React, or Angular (Choose one)
Backend: NodeJS

## Gameplay:
City Selection: Each cop independently chooses one city from below to investigate:
City Distance from current city
Yapkashnagar 60 KM
Lihaspur 50 KM
Narmis City 40 KM
Shekharvati 30 KM
Nuravgram 20 KM



## Vehicle Selection: Based on the chosen city's distance, each cop selects an electric vehicle considering its range and availability:
Kind       Range    Count 
EV Bike    60 KM    2
EV Car     100 KM   1
EV SUV     120 KM   1


## Result: The system determines if any cop successfully found the fugitive (simulated). If found, it displays the name of the cop who made the successful capture.






## Technical Requirements:

Frontend:

Develop screens for below:
Start/Landing page
Selection of city for each cop
